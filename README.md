# README

Hello! This is a very simple backend JSON API built in Rails. Thanks so much for taking the time to look through it, and I look forward to your feedback!

## Setup
1. git clone git@github.com/sarynm12/blog-posts-api.git
2. cd blog_posts_api
3. bundle install
4. rails db:{create,migrate,seed}
5. bundle exec rspec to run the test suite

## Timing Notes
My apologies for the extended time it took for me to complete this! Actual hours spent on it was not as much as noted - I had to set it aside for a few hours to help my team at work to put out a few fires. When it rains, it pours! Thanks so much in advance for your time and efforts.
